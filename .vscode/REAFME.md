# üöÄ Knapsack Problem Algorithms (C Implementation)

This repository provides implementations of various algorithms to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using the C programming language. The algorithms demonstrate different approaches and are designed to compare their performance and execution times.

## üìÇ **Implemented Algorithms**
1. [**Bruteforce (BF)**](Bruteforce): Exhaustive search to find the optimal solution.
2. [**Dynamic Programming (DP)**](Dynamic%20Programming): Efficient method that uses a table to solve subproblems.
3. [**Genetic Algorithm (GA)**](Genetic%20Algorithm): Evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection.
4. [**Greedy Algorithm**](Greedy): Heuristic method that prioritizes items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.
5. [**Simulated Annealing (SA)**](Simulated%20Annealing): Optimization method inspired by annealing in metallurgy.
6. [**Iterative Improvement (IP)**](Iterativeimprovement): Improves an initial solution iteratively until no better solution is found.
