## üìù **Algorithm Details**

### **1. Bruteforce (BF)**  
- Exhaustive search that explores all possible combinations of items to find the optimal solution.  
- Guarantees the best result but is computationally expensive as the number of items increases.  
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where (n) is the number of items.


---

### **2. Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
- Efficiently solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing intermediate results in a table.  
- Solves the problem in a bottom-up manner, avoiding redundant calculations.  
- Guarantees an optimal solution.  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * W), where (n) is the number of items and (W) is the knapsack capacity.


---

### **3. Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  
- Evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection.  
- Utilizes populations of solutions and evolves them through selection, crossover, and mutation to approximate the optimal solution.  
- Best suited for large or complex problems where exact solutions are computationally infeasible.  
- Does not guarantee an optimal solution but often provides near-optimal results.  
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on population size, number of generations, and mutation/crossover rates.

---

### **4. Greedy Algorithm**  
- Heuristic method that selects items based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order.  
- Quickly generates a feasible solution but does not guarantee the optimal one, especially for cases where high-value items with large weights are skipped.  
- Best used for approximate solutions in time-sensitive scenarios.  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log n), due to sorting of items.

---

### **5. Simulated Annealing (SA)**  
- Optimization method inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.  
- Explores the solution space by accepting suboptimal solutions temporarily to escape local optima.  
- Gradually reduces the acceptance probability of worse solutions as the algorithm progresses (cooling schedule).  
- Effective for large-scale or constrained problems but requires careful parameter tuning.  
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the cooling schedule and the number of iterations.

---

### **6. Iterative Improvement (IP)**  
- Starts with a feasible solution and iteratively refines it by modifying the selection of items in the knapsack.  
- Evaluates neighboring solutions by adding or removing items and accepts changes only if they improve the total value.  
- Simple and intuitive but may get stuck in local optima.  
- Often used to refine heuristic solutions.  
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the number of iterations and neighboring solutions considered.

---

### **7. Project Knapsack**  
- A project-specific implementation that combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Iterative Improvement (IP) to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.
- It integrates multiple GA techniques, including elitism, crossover, mutation, and adaptive mutation, and applies iterative improvement to refine the solutions.
- The implementation allows for time-limited execution to explore trade-offs between runtime and result quality.
- **Time Complexity**: Varies depending on the algorithms used and their respective input parameters.
